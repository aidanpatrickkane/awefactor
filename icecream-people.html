   <h1>The Icecream People</h1>
   <h2> - Charles Bukowski</h2>
   <p>the lady has me temporarily off the bottle
       <br>
       and now the pecker stands up better
       <br>
       however, things change overnight--<br>
       instead of listening to Shostakovich and<br>
       Mozart through a smeared haze of smoke<br>
       the nights change, new<br>
       complexities:<br>
       we drive to Baskin-Robbins,<br>
       31 flavors:<br>
       Rocky Road, Bubble Gum, Apricot Ice, Strawberry<br>
       Cheesecake, Chocolate Mint...<br>
       <br>
       we park outside and look at icecream<br>
       people<br>
       a very healthy and satisfied people,<br>
       nary a potential suicide in sight<br>
       (they probably even vote)<br>
       and I tell her<br>
       "what if the boys saw me go in there? suppose they<br>
       find out I'm going in for a walnut peach sundae?"<br>
       "come on, chicken," she laughs and we go in<br>
       and stand with the icecream people.<br>
       none of them are cursing or threatening<br>
       the clerks.<br>
       there seem to be no hangovers or<br>
       grievances.<br>
       I am alarmed at the placid and calm wave<br>
       that flows about. I feel like a ***** in a<br>
       beauty contest. we finally get our sundaes and<br>
       sit in the car and eat them.<br>
       <br>
       I must admit they are quite good. a curious new<br>
       world. (all my friends tell me I am looking<br>
       better. "you're looking good, man, we thought you<br>
       were going to die there for a while...")<br>
       --those 4,500 dark nights, the jails, the<br>
       hospitals...<br>
      
       and later that night<br>
       there is use for the pecker, use for<br>
       love, and it is glorious,<br>
       long and true,<br>
       and afterwards we speak of easy things;<br>
       our heads by the open window with the moonlight<br>
       looking through, we sleep in each other's<br>
       arms.<br>
       <br>
       the icecream people make me feel good,<br>
       inside and out.
       <br>
