    <h1>The Icecream People</h1>
    <p>the lady has me temporarily off the bottle
        and now the pecker stands up
        better.
        however, things change overnight--
        instead of listening to Shostakovich and
        Mozart through a smeared haze of smoke
        the nights change, new
        complexities:
        we drive to Baskin-Robbins,
        31 flavors:
        Rocky Road, Bubble Gum, Apricot Ice, Strawberry
        Cheesecake, Chocolate Mint...
        
        we park outside and look at icecream
        people
        a very healthy and satisfied people,
        nary a potential suicide in sight
        (they probably even vote)
        and I tell her
        "what if the boys saw me go in there? suppose they
        find out I'm going in for a walnut peach sundae?"
        "come on, chicken," she laughs and we go in
        and stand with the icecream people.
        none of them are cursing or threatening
        the clerks.
        there seem to be no hangovers or
        grievances.
        I am alarmed at the placid and calm wave
        that flows about. I feel like a ***** in a
        beauty contest. we finally get our sundaes and
        sit in the car and eat them.
        
        I must admit they are quite good. a curious new
        world. (all my friends tell me I am looking
        better. "you're looking good, man, we thought you
        were going to die there for a while...")
        --those 4,500 dark nights, the jails, the
        hospitals...
        
        and later that night
        there is use for the pecker, use for
        love, and it is glorious,
        long and true,
        and afterwards we speak of easy things;
        our heads by the open window with the moonlight
        looking through, we sleep in each other's
        arms.
        
        the icecream people make me feel good,
        inside and out.</p>
