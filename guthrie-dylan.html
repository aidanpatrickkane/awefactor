   <h1>Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie</h1>
   <h2> - Bob Dylan</h2>
   <br>
   <p><br>When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb


       <br>When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb
      
       <br>When yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace
      
       In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race<br>
      
       No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up<br>
      
       If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup<br>
      
       If the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on<br>
      
       And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone<br>
      
       And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it<br>
      
       And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it<br>
      
       And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long<br>
      
       And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong<br>
      
       And lonesome comes up as down goes the day<br>
      
       And tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away<br>
      
       And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'<br>
      
       And yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'<br>
      
       And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
       <br>
       Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys
       <br>
       And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'
       <br>
       And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'
       <br>
       And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'
       <br>
       And yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'
       <br>
       And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm
       <br>
       And to yourself you sometimes say
       <br>
       "I never knew it was gonna be this way
       <br>
       Why didn't they tell me the day I was born"
       <br>
       And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat
       <br>
       And you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet
       <br>
       And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air
       <br>
       And the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare
       <br>
       And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying
       <br>
       And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'
       <br>
       And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet
       <br>
       And you need it badly but it lays on the street
       <br>
       And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat
       <br>
       And you think yer ears might a been hurt
       <br>
       Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt
       <br>
       And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush
       <br>
       When you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush
       <br>
       And all the time you were holdin' three queens
       <br>
       And it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean
       <br>
       Like in the middle of Life magazine
       <br>
       Bouncin' around a pinball machine
       <br>
       And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying
       <br>
       That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'
       <br>
       But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head
       <br>
       And it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed
       <br>
       And no matter how you try you just can't say it
       <br>
       And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it
       <br>
       And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head
       <br>
       And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead
       <br>
       And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth
       <br>
       And his jaws start closin with you underneath
       <br>
       And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind
       <br>
       And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign
       <br>
       And you say to yourself just what am I doin'
       <br>
       On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'
       <br>
       On this curve I'm hanging
       <br>
       On this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking
       <br>
       In this air I'm inhaling
       <br>
       Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard
       <br>
           "I never knew it was gonna be this way
           <br>
           Why didn't they tell me the day I was born"
           <br>
           And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat
           <br>
           And you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet
           <br>
           And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air
           <br>
           And the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare
           <br>
           And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying
           <br>
           And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'
           <br>
           And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet
           <br>
           And you need it badly but it lays on the street
           <br>

           Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard
           <br>
           Why am I walking, where am I running
           <br>
           What am I saying, what am I knowing
           <br>
           On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'
           <br>
           On this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'
           <br>
           In the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'
           <br>
           In the words that I'm thinkin'
           <br>
           In this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'
           <br>
           Who am I helping, what am I breaking
           <br>
           What am I giving, what am I taking
           <br>
           But you try with your whole soul best
           <br>
           Never to think these thoughts and never to let
           <br>
           Them kind of thoughts gain ground
           <br>

   Or make yer heart pound
<br>
   But then again you know why they're around
   <br>
   On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'
   <br>
       On this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'
       <br>
       In the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'

       Them kind of thoughts gain ground
       <br>
       Or make yer heart pound
       <br>
       But then again you know why they're around
       <br>
       Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
       <br>
       "Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping
       <br>
       And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping
       <br>
       And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'
       <br>
       And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking
       <br>
       If that was you in the dream that was screaming
       <br>
       And you know that it's something special you're needin'
       <br>
       And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'
       <br>
       And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding
       <br>
       And you need something special
       <br>
       Yeah, you need something special all right
       <br>
       You need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track
       <br>
       To shoot you someplace and shoot you back
       <br>
       You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler
       <br>
       That's been banging and booming and blowing forever
       <br>
       That knows yer troubles a hundred times over
       <br>
       You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race
       <br>
       That won't laugh at yer looks
       <br>
       Your voice or your face
       <br>
       And by any number of bets in the book
       <br>
       Will be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze
       <br>
       You need something to open up a new door
       <br>
       To show you something you seen before
       <br>
       But overlooked a hundred times or more
       <br>
       You need something to open your eyes
       <br>
       You need something to make it known
       <br>
       That it's you and no one else that owns
       <br>
       That spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting
       <br>
       That the world ain't got you beat
       <br>
       That it ain't got you licked
       <br>
       It can't get you crazy no matter how many
       <br>
       Times you might get kicked
       <br>
       You need something special all right
       <br>
       You need something special to give you hope
       <br>
       But hope's just a word
       <br>
       That maybe you said or maybe you heard
       <br>
       On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve
       <br>
      
       But that's what you need man, and you need it bad
       <br>
       And yer trouble is you know it too good
       <br>
       "Cause you look an' you start getting the chills
       <br>
       <br>
      
       "Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill
       <br>
       And it ain't on Macy's window sill
       <br>
       And it ain't on no rich kid's road map
       <br>
       And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house
       <br>
       And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ
       <br>
       And it ain't on that dimlit stage
       <br>
       With that half-wit comedian on it
       <br>
       Ranting and raving and taking yer money
       <br>
       And you thinks it's funny
       <br>
       No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club
       <br>
       And it ain't in the seats of a supper club
       <br>
       And sure as hell you're bound to tell
       <br>
       That no matter how hard you rub
       <br>
       You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub
       <br>
       No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you
       <br>
       And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you
       <br>
       And it ain't in no cardboard-box house
       <br>
       Or down any movie star's blouse
       <br>
       And you can't find it on the golf course
       <br>
       And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus
       <br>
       And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes
       <br>
       And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons
       <br>
       And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices
       <br>
       That come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'
       <br>
       Sayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin
       <br>
       Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow
       <br>
       Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry
       <br>
       When you can't even sense if they got any insides
       <br>
       These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows
       <br>
       No you'll not now or no other day
       <br>
       Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache¥
       <br>
       And inside it the people made of molasses
       <br>
       That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses
       <br>
       And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies
       <br>
       Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny
       <br>
       Who breathe and burp and bend and crack
       <br>
       And before you can count from one to ten
       <br>
       Do it all over again but this time behind yer back
       <br>
       My friend
       <br>
       The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl
       <br>
       And play games with each other in their sand-box world
       <br>
       And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
       <br>
       That run around gallant
       <br>
       And make all rules for the ones that got talent
       <br>
       And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
       <br>
       And think they're foolin' you
       <br>
       The ones who jump on the wagon
       <br>
       Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
       <br>
       To get their kicks, get out of it quick
       <br>
       And make all kinds of money and chicks
       <br>
       And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
       <br>
       Sayin', "Christ do I gotta be like that
       <br>
       Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at
       <br>
       Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel
       <br>
       Good God Almighty
       <br>
       THAT STUFF AIN'T REAL"
       <br>
      
       <br>
       No but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race
       <br>
       You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face
       <br>
       You gotta look some other place
       <br>
       And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'
       <br>
       Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'
       <br>
       Where do you look for this oil well gushin'
       <br>
       Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'
       <br>
       Where do you look for this hope that you know is there
       <br>
       And out there somewhere
       <br>
       And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads
       <br>
       Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows
       <br>
       Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways
       <br>
       You can touch and twist
       <br>
       And turn two kinds of doorknobs
       <br>
       You can either go to the church of your choice
       <br>
       Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital
       <br>
       You'll find God in the church of your choice
       <br>
       You'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
       <br>
       <br>
      
       And though it's only my opinion
       <br>
       I may be right or wrong
       <br>
       You'll find them both
       <br>
       In the Grand Canyon
       <br>
       At sundown
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
